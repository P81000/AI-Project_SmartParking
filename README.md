# Intelligent Parking System with YOLOv8

Welcome to the Intelligent Parking System project repository, developed for the UNIFESP campus in São José dos Campos. This project leverages artificial intelligence and convolutional neural networks using the YOLOv8 model from Ultralytics.

## Project Objective

The main objective of this repository is to track the progress of building an intelligent parking system. By utilizing advanced computer vision techniques with the YOLO model, the project aims to detect and identify vehicles in parking spaces at the UNIFESP campus. This approach provides real-time monitoring and counting of available and occupied parking spots, offering users a more efficient and streamlined parking experience.

## Project Overview

This repository is organized into the following folders:

- **src**: Contains the source code used for testing and training the YOLOv8 model. The final_model folder includes the codes used in the final implementation, while the studying_model folder contains code used for studying the functionality of YOLO.
- **paper**: Includes the project's research paper and a PDF presentation.
- **data**: Consists of datasets, images, and other relevant data used for training and testing the models.
